A small and very simple Python script to check if a website responds
to requests or not.

It only support one site, no multi site check.

Can be run as a standalone script or cron.

It'll only notify offline status if the site has been unreachable for more
than OFFLINE_INTERVAL seconds. This way the server can be unresponsive
for a short while (reboot, maintenance, etc.). If the site is online again
within OFFLINE_INTERVAL you won't get any unnecessary notifications about the
short downtime.
